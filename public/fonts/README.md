# Artegra Sans Condensed SC Font for Airmana

## Font Files Needed

Place your custom font files in this directory with the following names:

- `artegra-sans-condensed-sc-regular.woff2` (preferred format for modern browsers)
- `artegra-sans-condensed-sc-regular.woff` (fallback for older browsers)

## Converting Your Font

If your font file is in a different format (like .ttf, .otf), you can convert it to web-friendly formats:

1. **Online converters** (recommended):
   - https://convertio.co/font-converter/
   - https://cloudconvert.com/font-converter
   - https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator

2. **What to convert**:
   - Convert your font file to both WOFF2 and WOFF formats
   - If you have separate files for regular and bold weights, convert both
   - If you only have one file, you can use it for both regular and bold

## File Naming

Rename your converted files to match the expected names:
- Your font file â†’ `artegra-sans-condensed-sc-regular.woff2` and `artegra-sans-condensed-sc-regular.woff`

## After Adding Files

Once you've placed the font files in this directory, the Artegra Sans Condensed SC font will automatically be applied to:
- The AIRMANA business name/logo (displayed in uppercase)
- All headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)

The font sizes and spacing will remain exactly the same - only the font family will change.
